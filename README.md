# DISCMON

A discord bot to play Pokemon.

This is a refactor of a past, private multi-threaded python program I made that ran the emulator and a discord bot on seperate threads. It uses typescript for the discord bot and links with the already existing python emulator using Flask. I would love to add some improvements in the future like moving multiple spaces at once, keeping track of moves the player's pokemon have so that the controls can change to a battle scheme, and more. If you want to use this project, you will have to set up your own bot and legally obtain your own ROM of gameboy red in the ".gb" format.

## The Bot in Action!
