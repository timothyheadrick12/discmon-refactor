# Plan for Project Structure

## Game class

---

- On input receive save frames from slightly before input to slightly after input as gif.

- Should constantly be ticking. No reason not to currently. Possibly implement pausing

- Create eventstack so that events can overflow then execute in order

---

## PokemonEmu class

---

- Put all Pokemon specific events within this class.

---

## DiscordClient class

---

- TODO
